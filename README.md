## Meetups Guide

Our meetups are structured to mirror the various sections of the FreeCodeCamp curriculum so as to aid your learning process.

For the sake of simplicity, we’ll focus on these sections for now:

1. HTML & CSS
2. Bootstrap & jQuery 
3. JavaScript
4. Frontend Projects
5. Git and GitHub.

You can think of them as individual units. For each unit, we’ll organize the meetups in two formats: 
- Teaching Format - In this meetup, we’ll be teaching you to the syntax and concepts. 
- Practice Format - In this meetup, you’ll be solving the curriculum challenges by pair programming. You can also approach the mentors whenever you get stuck.


> ### The motive here is to encourage the campers to move to a new topic only when they feel comfortable with the old ones. This entire structure is our attempt to accomplish that intention.

We have dedicated rooms for each unit on our Discord. These rooms can be used to share resources, help each other when you get stuck as well as ask questions during our meetups. 

The meetups for each unit will be discussed and announced inside their respective rooms. For example, a practice session on JavaScript, in which we may solve a few algorithm challenges together, can be planned inside the JavaScript room. 

The members of the room can vote on which format they’ll like us to organize the next meetup and based on the results, we’ll arrange it in two weeks.

If a certain member finishes a unit way before we can organize the next meetup, they can either spend time guiding their fellow campers or continue with the curriculum.

We encourage our members to help their fellow campers by attending the practice sessions for the units they have already completed.

### How can I join the community directly?
You can join our community directly by submitting this [Membership Form](https://goo.gl/18XFsX)

### What if I reach a section that doesn’t have it’s own dedicated room?
We will create a new dedicated room if at least 10 members reach that section.
