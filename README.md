# Meetups Guide

The latest structure that we’re going to follow for organizing our meetups from now on will mirror the FreeCodeCamp curriculum. Meaning, we’ll be organizing our meetups based on the various sections of the curriculum to aid your learning process, instead of diverting or obstructing you.  


	

As you can see, there are many individual sections for which we’ll need to organize meetups. But for the sake of simplicity and gradual growth, we’ll just focus on the main topics for now i.e, html/css, bootstrap/jQuery, JavaScript, Frontend Projects and git/GitHub. You can think of these sections as individual units.

For each unit, we’ll organize the meetups in two formats : 
Teaching Format - In this format, we’ll teach you the syntax or an internal concept for that topic. 
Practice Format - In this format, you’ll go through the curriculum on your own with us guiding you when you get stuck. 



As you can see, we have already created the required dedicated rooms. These rooms will be open to all our Discord members, at least for now. 

The meetups for each unit will be organized inside their respective rooms. For example, the practice session for JavaScript (in which we can solve a few algorithm challenges together), will be organized inside the JavaScript room. 

We’ll decide which meetup to do when based on voting. We’ll ask the members of the room to vote on which format they’ll like us to organize in,  - teaching or practice. And based on the results, we’ll plan for that meetup two weeks in advance.

If a certain member finishes a section way before we can organize a meetup for the next one, they can spend their time guiding their fellow campers still going through the previous units, either virtually or by helping in the practice sessions. They can also approach the mentors with their doubts individually in the practice sessions or ask in the Discord group.

If sufficient number of members (say 8 for now) reach a new unit in the curriculum that requires it’s own dedicated room, like “JSON APIs and Ajax,“ then we’ll create the new room and organize the meetups for that unit in that room only. 

The dedicated rooms can be used to ask questions, share resources, help each other when you get stuck as well. We can also utilize these rooms for live questions in our meetups.
