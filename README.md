# Meetups Guide

There will be four official types of meetups that we’ll organize every month. These will be as follows :
	
1. ###Intro To Web Development : 
  A series of four meetups that will be organized every weekend, targeted towards absolute and intermediate beginners. The mentors of the community will introduce you to the fundamental concepts of web development. They will go as follows : 

    * ####Intro to HTML, CSS and jQuery (Level 1) : 
    This meetup will be organized on the first weekend of the month. It’s targeted towards people who do not know anything about HTML, CSS and jQuery. We’ll introduce you to these concepts and show you how you can build a basic portfolio site using them. This will be a public event, meaning it will be posted and promoted on social media to be discovered by as many people as possible. 

    * ####Intro to JavaScript (Level 2) : 
      In this meetup, we’ll introduce you to the basics of JavaScript. We’ll also try to solve some basic challenges using what we just learned and give you some more challenges to work on at home. Only the members who have attended the previous meetup will be notified about this one. 

    * ####Internet Protocols and REST API (Level 3) : 
      In this meetup, we’ll talk about the HTTP protocol and show you how to make API requests to external websites. For practice, we’ll show you how to use the GitHub API to build a project that fetchs the profile data for any username you submit. This will also be a closed event, and only those who have attended the previous meetup will be notified about it. 
      
    * ####Code Improvement Session (Level 4) : 
      In this meetup, which will be the final one in this series, the mentors will go through your solutions for the Algorithm Challenges on the FreeCodeCamp website. We’ll review the code and show you what improvements you can make. Only those who have attended the previous meetup will be notified about this one.

2. ###Digging Deeper Meetups : 
  We’ll be organizing a series of meetups called “Digging Deeper into X” where X stands for some language/tool. For example, we’ll  be having “Digging Deeper into JavaScript” which could introduce you to the Functional Programming Paradigm. At the moment, we can only have 2- 3 such meetups in a month, due to lack of sufficient mentors. These meetups will be closed, meaning only those members from the community who are comfortable with the topics taught in the “Intro to Web Development” series will be notified about them.

3. ###Pair Programming Meetups : 
  Along with the digging deeper meetups, we'll also be organizing a few pair programming sessions. In these sessions, the attendees can partner with someone to work on some project together, helping each other learn every step of the way. A pair programming session can be organized even at a local coffee shop. At the moment, we can only have one such meetup a month, due to lack of sufficient mentors.

#Discord Roles and Rooms : 
For such a structure to work seamlessly, we’ll need a way to contain various subsets of the community in their own dedicated groups. For example, all the people who just attended the level 1 meetup of the Intro to Web Development (ItWD) series need to be contained in one place, so that we can provide them additional resources, let them discuss topics, ask questions that might be relevant to others and get updates about the next meetup (level 2). To do this, we take advantage of the roles feature in Discord.

As you can see in the image above, we have created four special roles based on the ItWD series. When a member attends one of the ItWD meetups, s/he is awarded the special role for that meetup, which gives them access to the dedicated Discord room for the next meetup that follows. 

For example, on attending a Level 2 meetup, you’ll be given the Level 2 role, which will give you access to the Stage 2 room where additional resources and discussions on the topics taught in the previous meetup will take place and updates for Level 3 will be provided. On receiving the Level 4 role, you’ll get access to all the special core rooms.

As you can see, we have dedicated rooms for html, css, JavaScript, git/GitHub and many more. 

The “Digging Deeper into X” meetups will be organized inside these rooms. So, for example, if you are comfortable with the basics of JavaScript, and want to dig deeper, you can hangout in the JavaScript room where you can ask or answer questions, share resources, and plan when to do a “Digging Deeper into JavaScript” meetup. The final decision will be taken by the mentors, but you can always request for one.

As we move forward and grow our community, we would be adding more such dedicated core rooms.
